1) "PUBLIC" keyword means you can access this member from anywhere.

2) "PROTECTED" only subclass in different pkg (i.e., inheritance) can access the members that protected

3) If "MODIFIER" is not written then default access modifier will be called which means that,

    1) if access within same package where class is defined, it will treat this as public,

    2) if access from another package where class is not defined, then it will not allow.

4) "PRIVATE" keyword means you will only be able to access this member inside class in which it is decleared as "private".


            Class   Package     Subclass    Subclass    Anywhere
                               (same pkg)  (diff pkg)   

public        +         +           +           +           +

protected     +         +           +           +

no modifier   +         +           +

private       +

Note : access modifier of overriden method should be same or better then parent method.
for example :- if parent's method is protected then you can't name the child method to no modifier or private, it should better than parent's name, like public (expending scope, not restricting it), use table given above ^.
