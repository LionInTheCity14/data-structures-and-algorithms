/**
 * Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start-i,
 * end-i], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array
 * of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals
 * in the input.

 * Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 * Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 * Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

 * Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
 * Output: [[1,5]]
 * Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
 * intervals[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= start-i <= end-i <= 10^4
