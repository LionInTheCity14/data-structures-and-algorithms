/**
 * Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element
 * appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

 * You must implement a solution with a linear runtime
 * complexity and use only constant extra space.

 * Input: nums = [2,2,1]
 * Output: 1

 * Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
 * Output: 4

 * Input: nums = [1]
 * Output: 1

 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
 * -3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
 * Each element in the array appears twice except for one
 *  element which appears only once.
