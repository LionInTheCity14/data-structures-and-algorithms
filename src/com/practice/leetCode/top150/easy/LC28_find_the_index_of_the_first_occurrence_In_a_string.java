/**
 * Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of
 * the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle
 * is not part of haystack.

 * Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
 * The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

 * Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we
 * return -1.

 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
 * haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English
 * characters.
