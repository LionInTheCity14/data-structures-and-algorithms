/**
 * Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a
 * mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).
 * <p>
 * Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
 * Output: true
 * <p>
 * Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
 * Output: false
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
 * -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 * <p>
 * Follow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
