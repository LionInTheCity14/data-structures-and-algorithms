1) Packagesa are ordered in hierarchical order (folder
inside a folder).

2) They are like compartments for files, they do not 
allow two files with same name in one package.

3) They prevent us from collision of two files with same 
name.

If files are on different folders then you have to import them,
if files are on same folder then you don't have to import them.

For example, file with name Message.java has one usecase 
in package A and different use case in different package B.
