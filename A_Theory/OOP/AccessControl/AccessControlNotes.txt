1) "PUBLIC" keyword means you can access this member from anywhere.

2) "PROTECTED" only subclass in different pkg (i.e., inheritance) can access the members that protected

3) If "MODIFIER" is not written then default access modifier will be called which means that,

    1) if access within same package where class is defined, it will treat this as public,

    2) if access from another package where class is not defined, then it will not allow.

4) "PRIVATE" keyword means you will only be able to access this member inside class in which it is decleared as "private".
