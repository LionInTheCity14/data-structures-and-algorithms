Encapsulation :- means wrapping up the implimentation of data members and methods inside a class, it hides the members into a single unit so that can be protected from outside world.

putting things in bundle by private keyword and only show properties by get and set methods.

data hiding (private keyword) focuses on data security and encapsulation focus on arapping data to hide the complexity of system.

Example for data hiding :   we use ArrayLists,
    
        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();

    we can modify this with list.add(), list.set() etc methods but "WE CAN'T ACCESS THE INTERNAL ARRAY WHICH IS USED TO MAKE THIS ARRAYLIST"

Datahiding is achieved via Encapsulation and Encapsulation is sub-process of Datahiding.

Abstraction :- Hiding unnessary details and only showing valuable information.

Example: To start a car we don't need to know all the mechanics of car, we just insert key and car starts.

Abstraction focus on external stuff (design level), Encapsulation focus on internal working of stuff (implimentation things).

Abstraction is the process of gaining the information and Encapsulation is the process of containing information.
