Abstract :- Parent class have abstract methods that must be overriden by child class. It is like parent has told child what you have to do, but how to is depend totally on child.

Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must be decleared as abstract. 

Things to remember :-

* Abstract classes does not support multiple inheritance.

* You can create normal methods in abstract classes.

* You can create static methods inside abstract class, which then can be call by class name (abstract methods means they have to be overriden, but static methods cannot be overriden).

* You cann't create the object of abstract class.

* You can declear some properties and constructor (constructor must not be type abstract), which will be called be child classes using super();

* Abstract classes cann't be final, because they made to be inherited by child classes

abstract class Parent{ 
    abstract void carrer(String name);

    static void greeting(){
        sout("Hello");
    }

    void normal(){
        sout("I am inside normal");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent{
    void carrer(String carrerName){
        carrerName = "Softwere Engineer";
    }
}
